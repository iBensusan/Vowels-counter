# Vowel Counter

This is a beginner-level Python script that counts the number of vowels in a given string. The program takes user input, processes the string, and outputs the total count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in both uppercase and lowercase forms.

## How It Works

The script converts the input string to lowercase and checks each character to see if it is a vowel. It uses a Python `set` for efficient vowel checking and returns the total number of vowels found.

### Features

- Efficient use of a `set` for quick vowel lookups.
- Accepts user input for flexibility.
- Handles both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

## Requirements

- Python3
